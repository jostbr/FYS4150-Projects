In this directory is benchmark results from running the code in ../src.
Every data file in this directory can be reproduced by running ../src/main.cpp
with different command line arguments (see below). In addition to obtain the
non-interacting results, make sure that fill_array() is called in main.cpp.
Similarly for the interacting case, make sure fill_array_interactive() is called.
